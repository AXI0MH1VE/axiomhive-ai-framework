### Known Vulnerabilities Without Patches

#### Ray (Distributed Computing)

**Status**: REMOVED from requirements.txt

**Original Version**: 2.41.0

**Vulnerabilities**:
1. **CVE-TBD** - Critical: Arbitrary code execution via jobs submission API
   - **CVSS Score**: Critical
   - **Description**: Ray has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution through the jobs submission API
   - **Patched Version**: None available as of October 20, 2025

2. **CVE-TBD** - Moderate: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
   - **CVSS Score**: Moderate
   - **Description**: Ray logs may contain sensitive information
   - **Patched Version**: None available as of October 20, 2025

**Mitigation Strategy**:

Ray has been **removed** from the project dependencies due to the critical vulnerability with no available patch. If distributed computing capabilities are required, consider the following alternatives:

1. **Dask** (already included): Use Dask for distributed data processing
   - Dask provides similar distributed computing capabilities with better security posture
   - Already included in requirements.txt as `dask[complete]==2023.11.0`

2. **Apache Spark**: Consider PySpark for large-scale distributed computing
   - More mature ecosystem with active security maintenance
   - Better suited for production environments

3. **Celery**: For task queue and job distribution
   - Well-established security practices
   - Actively maintained with regular security updates

**If Ray must be used**:
- Deploy Ray in an isolated, sandboxed environment
- Implement strict network access controls
- Never expose Ray's jobs submission API to untrusted networks
- Monitor Ray logs for sensitive information leakage
- Regularly check for security updates: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/security
- Consider implementing additional authentication layers

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Send a detailed report to the project maintainers via GitHub Security Advisories
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

## Security Best Practices

When using this framework:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly run `pip list --outdated` and update dependencies
2. **Monitor Security Advisories**: Watch for Dependabot alerts and GitHub Security Advisories
3. **Use Virtual Environments**: Always use isolated Python virtual environments
4. **Implement Access Controls**: Restrict API access to authorized users only
5. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use strong encryption for data at rest and in transit
6. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security reviews of the codebase
7. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
8. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security best practices for API keys and credentials

## Security Update Schedule
